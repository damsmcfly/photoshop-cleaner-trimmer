ATN action set and their JSX scripts.  
This ATN action set makes it easy to clean up and trim your images.

## ATN files
To install the ATN action set, take the following steps: 
- In Photoshop open the Actions Panel ```Window → Actions```.
- Click the fly-out menu in the top right corner of the Actions Panel.
- Choose ```Load Actions``` from the list.
- Locate the ```.atn``` file on your hard drive and click open to install.

The action set will now appear as a folder in the Actions Panel.


## JSX files
The ATN action set needs the JSX files to function correctly.  
Place JSX files in the Photoshop Scripts folder:
- OS X: ```/Applications/Adobe Photoshop [version]/Presets/Scripts/```
- Windows (32 bit): ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [version]\Presets\Scripts\```
- Windows (64 bit): ```C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop [version] (64 Bit)\Presets\Scripts\```

Restart Photoshop  

You can also setup custom hotkeys in ```Edit → Keyboard Shortctus… ```
